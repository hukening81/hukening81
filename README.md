Should spend more time coding rather than polishing Github profile

I use Linux(arch) for pragmatic reasons, mainly for its Tiling Window Manager( or compositor). 
- One compensation is that I can't get to play around in FL Studio.
- And Musescore Studio please fix your Wayland support

I like Rust for its easy to use toolchain(for my dumb brain), relatively large 3rd party libs and abled to used as a system programming language
